
# You are given a positive integer N,
# then you are given a large integer represented as an integer list, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer.
# You have to print the list contain every digit of the integer but incremented by 1.

# example

# input:    5
#           3
#           4
#           0
#           1
#           0 (these 5 digits are representing 34010)
# output:   [3, 4, 0, 1, 1]

# input:    7
#           3
#           0
#           9
#           9
#           9
#           9
#           9 (these 7 digits are representing 3099999)
# output:   [3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
